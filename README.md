The **Bank Loan Report**, created using **Power BI** and powered by SQL queries, provides an interactive visualization of key loan metrics for a financial institution. It offers a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio, including total disbursements, active loans, and customer demographics, presented through dynamic dashboards, bar charts, and geographic maps. The report tracks loan statuses, categorizing them as active, repaid, or delinquent, while highlighting high-risk loans based on customer credit scores and repayment histories. Visualizations such as stacked column charts, heat maps, and line graphs allow for an in-depth assessment of repayment trends, delinquency rates, and loan risk across regions and customer segments. Additionally, the report features insights into revenue generation through interest and principal collections, helping the bank optimize financial performance. With drill-through capabilities for more granular data, this report serves as a powerful tool for strategic decision-making in loan management.
